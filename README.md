## Development

### Adding New Features

1. Create new components in `src/components/`
2. Add corresponding styles in `src/styles/`
3. Update the main App component to include new routes

### Plaid Integration

- The app uses Plaid's Link component for secure bank authentication
- All Plaid API calls are proxied through the backend server
- Access tokens are stored server-side (in production, use a database)

### Styling

- CSS modules or regular CSS files
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Consistent color scheme and typography

## Production Deployment

### Environment Variables

- Set `NODE_ENV=production`
- Use production Plaid credentials
- Configure proper CORS settings
- Set up a production database for storing access tokens

### Security Considerations

- Never expose Plaid secrets in client-side code
- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement proper user authentication
- Store access tokens securely in a database

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Plaid Link not loading**

   - Check that the backend server is running
   - Verify Plaid credentials in `.env` file
   - Check browser console for errors

2. **CORS errors**

   - Ensure the backend server has CORS enabled
   - Check that the frontend is making requests to the correct URL

3. **Transaction data not loading**
   - Verify that the bank account is properly connected
   - Check that the access token is valid
   - Ensure the date range is within available data

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting `DEBUG=true` in the backend `.env` file.
